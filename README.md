# Number or Word Checker Program
This Python program takes a user input and checks if the input matches the number 42 or the word "forty two". It handles both numeric and text input, including special cases like "forty-two" with hyphens.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
How to Use:
Run the script.
When prompted, enter either a number or a word.
The program will check if the input matches 42 or forty two (in any case, and with hyphens replaced by spaces).
It will print "Yes" if it matches either, and "No" otherwise.

Example:
Input:
Enter a number or a word: forty-two
Output:
Yes

How It Works:
The program asks the user to enter a number or a word.
It strips any surrounding spaces and converts the input to lowercase.
It replaces any hyphens with spaces to handle inputs like "forty-two".
The program checks if the input matches 42 or forty two.
It prints "Yes" if it matches, otherwise it prints "No".
